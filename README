None.


COMPILATION & INSTALLATION

First, clone or download the code from GitHub. In order to compile the code, just type make in the iof code directory:

$> make

This will generate a static library file called libiof.a. Other code can then be linked against this library.

In order to clean up the code, type:

$> make clean

Assuming that the iof code directory is located within a local library directory (e.g. ~/libraries/ under your home directory) you can type:

$> make install

in the code directory. This will then generate symbolic links to the iof.h and libiof.a in the parallel directories ~/libraries/include/ and ~/libraries/lib/, respectively.
